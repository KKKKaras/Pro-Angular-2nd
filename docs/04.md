## 4.2 Understanding HTML
### 4.2.1 Understanding Void Elements
### 4.2.2 Understanding Attributes
### 4.2.3 Applying Attributes Without Values
### 4.2.4 Quoting Literal Values in Attributes

Angular relies on HTML element attributes to apply a lot of its functionality. Most of the time, the values of attributes are evaluated as JavaScript expressions.

The attribute applied to the td element tells Angular to read the value of a property called done on an object that has been assigned to a variable called item. 

```html
<td [ngSwitch]="item.done">
```

There will be occasions when you need to provide a specific value rather than have Angular read a value from the data model, and this requires additional quoting to tell Angular that it is dealing with a literal value:

```html
<td [ngSwitch]="'Apples'">
```

### 4.2.5 Understanding Element Content
### 4.2.6 Understanding the Document Structure

#### UNDERSTANDING THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL

When the browser loads and processes an htML document, it creates the Document Object Model (dOM). the dOM is a model in which JavaScript objects are used to represent each element in the document, and the dOM is the mechanism by which you can programmatically engage with the content of an htML document.

You rarely work directly with the dOM in angular, but it is important to understand that the browser maintains a live model of the htML document represented by JavaScript objects. When angular modifies these objects, the browser updates the content it displays to reflect the modifications. this is one of the key foundations of web applications. if we were not able to modify the dOM, we would not be able to create client-side web apps.

## 4.3 Understanding Bootstrap

CSS frameworks have emerged to help web app developers style their HTML content in a simple and consistent way.

### 4.3.1 Applying Basic Bootstrap Classes
#### 4.3.1.1 Using Contextual Classes
#### 4.3.1.2 Using Margin and Padding
#### 4.3.1.3 Changing Element Sizes
### 4.3.2 Using Bootstrap to Style Tables
### 4.3.3 Using Bootstrap to Create Forms
### 4.3.4 Using Bootstrap to Create Grids
#### 4.3.4.1 Creating Responsive Grids

| Bootstrap Classes |                                       Description                                       |
|:-----------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| col-sm-*          | Grid cells are displayed horizontally when the screen width is greater than 768 pixels. |
| col-md-*          | Grid cells are displayed horizontally when the screen width is greater than 940 pixels. |
| col-lg-*          | Grid cells are displayed horizontally when the screen width is greater than 1170pixels. |
